	i used a threshold value of 1 to see the hidden text

2. I used a threshold value of 125 because it the text looked the clearest without the edges of the page interfering with the text. There is no single 'best' threshold value, i found that values between 100 and 135 make the text black and the background white without the edges of the page becoming to noticeable

4. To enhance the edges in Photoshop i chose the find edges filter (Filter->Stylize->Find Edges
	This appears to remove the fill of the music notes leaving only the edges. The flaw of this is that its more difficult to differentiate between different notes and read the words/numbers
