            For my net art piece I thought it would be interesting to design an interactive visual ping map of the world. <br>
            By that I mean, a user could select a point on the map, ping that location, and actually visualize the time it would take for that ping to return. <br>
            <br>
            Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.<br>
            It measures the round-trip time (usually in milliseconds) for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source.
            <br>
            <br>
            The user would start by seeing a map of the world with their location as a point on the map
        </p>
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_my_location.png" style="width: 50%">
        <p>
            The user would then pick some point on the map that they want to ping
        </p>
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_target_location.png" style="width: 50%">

        <p>
            It would then show the ping traverse the world toward the destination, ping, and return.
        </p>
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_begin_ping.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_greenishyellow_ping.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_orange_ping.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_end_ping.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_end_ping_ping.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_mid_return.png" style="width: 50%">
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_return.png" style="width: 50%">
        <p>
            This animation would last as long as it took for the ping to reach destination and back.<br>
            The user could then select another point and repeat the animation(previous pings remain on the map)
        </p>
        <img src="../Resources/Newworldmap_multi_ping.png" style="width: 50%" >
        <p>
            I guess there could be some text that pops up after the ping returns that would indicate the actual ping in milliseconds, or a table underneath showing the most recent pings.<br>
            But thats all extra stuff I'd do if I had to implement this. <br>
            I think this would be a pretty cool visualization of a measurement of data being sent across an Internet communication link.<br>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left">
            <p>Some obvious problems I can see with implementing this would be:</p>
            
                <ul style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 200px">
                    <li>Since ping is measured in milliseconds, the animation would happen at lightning speed and no one would be able to see it. So maybe I could slow the animation down by some factor relative to the actual ping speed, to make it more visually appealing</li>
                    <li>I would need to have an accurate list of IP Addresses around the world so that the user could potentially click anywhere in the world as a destination</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
